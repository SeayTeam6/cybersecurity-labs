## Active Directory 
Created a  resource group, virtual network, and subnet in Azure, followed that up by deploying a Windows Server VM that will act as the domain server, assigned it a static private IP, and disabled the firewall for connectivity testing. I deployed a second Windows Virtuall Machine which will act as the Client in the same region and virtual network, its DNS settings are pointed to Domain servers private IP, the VM is restarted, and connectivity is verified by pinging the Domain Server and confirming its DNS configuration in PowerShell.
